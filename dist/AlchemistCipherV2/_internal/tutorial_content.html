<h2>Understanding Logical Reasoning</h2>

<h3>1. Direct Clues</h3>
<p>These are the simplest type of clues. They directly tell you that a symbol maps to a specific letter.</p>
<p><b>Example:</b> "α maps to the letter 'A'"</p>
<p>This is a <i>direct assignment</i> - you can immediately fill in this mapping.</p>

<h3>2. Exclusion Clues</h3>
<p>These tell you what a symbol <i>cannot</i> be, helping you eliminate possibilities.</p>
<p><b>Example:</b> "β does not map to 'B'"</p>
<p>This is an <i>elimination</i> technique - you can mark 'B' as impossible for β.</p>

<h3>3. Positional Clues</h3>
<p>These relate symbols to their position in a sequence (less common in simple symbol ciphers, more in ordering puzzles).</p>
<p><b>Example:</b> "γ is at position 3 in the sequence"</p>
<p>This helps you understand the <i>relative ordering</i>.</p>

<h3>4. Relational Clues</h3>
<p>These show relationships between symbols or letters.</p>
<p><b>Example:</b> "The letter for 'δ' comes later in the alphabet than the letter for 'ε'."</p>
<p>This helps you understand <i>conditional relationships</i>.</p>

<h3>5. Category Clues</h3>
<p>These group symbols or letters by shared characteristics.</p>
<p><b>Example:</b> "ζ maps to a vowel"</p>
<p>This uses <i>classification</i> to narrow down possibilities.</p>

<h2>Solving Strategies</h2>

<h3>1. Process of Elimination</h3>
<p>Start by eliminating impossible options based on exclusion clues.</p>

<h3>2. Cross-Referencing</h3>
<p>Use multiple clues together to narrow down possibilities. If 'α' is a vowel, and 'α' isn't 'A' or 'E', what remains?</p>

<h3>3. Deductive Reasoning</h3>
<p>If A implies B, and B implies C, then A implies C. If 'β' must be a consonant, and the only available consonants are 'X' and 'Y', and another clue tells you 'β' is not 'X', then 'β' must be 'Y'.</p>

<h3>4. Contradiction</h3>
<p>If assuming 'γ' is 'Z' leads to a violation of another clue (a contradiction), then 'γ' cannot be 'Z'.</p>

<h2>Tips for Success</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Start with direct clues to establish known mappings.</li>
    <li>Use exclusion clues to eliminate possibilities systematically.</li>
    <li>Look for clues that interact or constrain each other.</li>
    <li>Keep track of possibilities (a grid can be helpful!).</li>
    <li>Don't be afraid to make temporary assumptions, but be ready to backtrack if they lead to contradictions.</li>
</ul>
